                <li>In high school, I had an entire years worth of JavaScript to make some games like tic tac toe.</li>
                <li>Today, I found that we are able to test JavaScript code through VSCode! I have done this before with python, but I never realized that it could be used for other languages. I want to also apply these scripting skills eventually towards React.</li>
