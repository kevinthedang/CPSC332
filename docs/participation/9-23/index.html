                Which kinds of use cases do you imagine the techniques demonstrated in this video might be useful for?
                <ul>
                    <li class="answer">I could imagine if I wanted to change the state of something, like a button, I would use this to get rid 
                        of all the elements associated with it and set it to something else. With the many options the use can use to interact with the object, 
                        using the all: unset attribute can be useful for a dynamic page with a lot of changes. Another case can be when someone is interacts with 
                        an object, it allows for that object to remove all of its style so nothing will stick on it when you want to change the object completely.

                What is the one thing you found most surprising about the techniques demonstrated in this video?
                <ul>
                    <li class="answer">I think the most surprising technique I saw was that he used a class for the style so that it does not need to affect all 
                        buttons but only specific buttons that would want their styles removed and changed. What also seems to be interesting is that since there 
                        are more options for interaction for users, we could probably unset things we already unset and add more things to make it interesting. 
                        Implementing this may not be very common but it can be cool I would think.

                How might you use this to benefit your CSS styling in your future web development projects?
                <ul>
                    <li class="answer">I think this would benefit me with allowing me to code with more variety with my pages on github. Most likely I will use 
                        this attribute to change something completely by using on click attributes. Besides that I usually just like the hover effect so changing 
                        something completely would work with that well.
